âœ… 1. Detection Logic Changed: Heuristics â†’ Semantic Similarity
ðŸ”¸ Before:

Used static lists of safe_items and harmful_items (hardcoded words).

Relied on:

Keyword matches

Simple regex patterns

Word count thresholds

ðŸ”¸ Now:

Uses machine learning (embeddings) to understand meaning of text.

Compares user input to known safe and harmful examples using semantic similarity (cosine distance).

No longer depends on exact keyword matches â€” it "understands" context.

âœ… 2. Learning from Examples Instead of Rules
ðŸ”¸ Before:

Detection logic was static and required manual list updates.

ðŸ”¸ Now:

Learns from a few example sentences:

Safe claims like "Water is essential for life."

Harmful claims like "Drink bleach to cure viruses."

These examples are turned into embeddings (numerical meaning vectors).

You can easily expand knowledge by adding more examples â€” no code changes needed.

âœ… 3. Confidence Scores Based on Similarity Metrics
ðŸ”¸ Before:

Confidence was hardcoded (e.g., 99.9% if harmful keyword + "drink").

ðŸ”¸ Now:

Confidence is dynamically derived from the cosine similarity score (0â€“1 scaled to 0â€“100).

The closer the user text is to harmful/safe examples, the higher the confidence in the label.

âœ… 4. Contextual Understanding Introduced
ðŸ”¸ Before:

Could not tell the difference between:

"Mercury is harmful" (true)

"Mercury cures cancer" (false)

Treated any presence of "mercury" as potentially harmful/fake.

ðŸ”¸ Now:

Captures sentence-level semantics, understanding intent and context, not just word presence.

âœ… 5. Easily Extendable to Online Learning or Real-Time Updates
ðŸ”¸ Before:

You would need to manually update keyword lists to "teach" the system something new.

ðŸ”¸ Now:

You can:

Add more training examples without changing code.

Dynamically load examples from web sources or articles.

Integrate with knowledge bases or search APIs in the future.











ðŸ”„ Implementing RAG for Real-Time Fact Retrieval
1. Web Scraping and Data Extraction

Utilize web scraping tools to collect factual data from reputable sources:

Scrapy: A powerful Python framework for web crawling and data extraction. It's designed for scalability and efficiency.

2. Integrating External Knowledge Sources

Incorporate structured data from reliable knowledge bases:

Wikidata: A vast, multilingual knowledge base that provides structured data on various topics. 
realpython.com

DBpedia: Extracts structured content from Wikipedia, offering a semantic web database for querying relationships and properties. 
realpython.com

Data Commons: Combines economic, scientific, and other public datasets into a unified view, providing a rich source of factual information. 
realpython.com

3. Processing and Embedding Data

Convert the fetched data into embeddings using models like Sentence-Transformers. This step allows your system to compare and retrieve relevant information based on semantic similarity.

4. Retrieving Relevant Information

When a user submits a claim:

Fetch: Retrieve the most relevant documents or data points from your knowledge base using similarity search.

Rank: Rank these documents based on relevance to the user's query.

Verify: Use Natural Language Inference (NLI) models to assess the veracity of the claim against the retrieved information.

5. Generating a Response

Combine the retrieved information with your model's capabilities to generate a comprehensive response, providing users with accurate and up-to-date facts.
